                    <p>
                        After years leading innovation and operations at Starbucks, I founded 
                        Crafted Consulting to help brands and retailers bring clarity to complexity and turn great 
                        ideas into results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I’ve always loved the intersection of creativity and execution — where strategy meets the 
                        real world. Whether it’s launching a new food program, designing a retail concept, or 
                        building the process behind a global rollout, I thrive on helping teams move from concept 
                        to scale. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Crafted Consulting, I partner with teams who need a fractional leader or strategic thought 
                        partner — someone who can jump in, build the plan, and get things moving. My background spans 
                        cafés, coffee, and fresh food, giving me a deep understanding of end-to-end operations and 
                        what it takes to make growth stick. I love helping teams find momentum, create scalable solutions, 
                        and build cultures that last.

                    <p>
                        I excel in managing uncertainty, creating structure, and supporting growth strategies from concept
                        to launch. With deep experience in retail, I help teams bring clarity, build momentum, and deliver 
                        lasting results - through growth strategy, program leadership, or as a trusted through partner 
                        for change.

                        Known as a natural collaborator and steady hand during times of massive growth, my superpower 
                        is designing process and structure while executing the plan.
