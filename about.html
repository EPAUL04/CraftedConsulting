                        Years ago, at Starbucks, I was standing in the middle of a brand-new concept launch.
                        The team was buzzing, deadlines were flying, and every day felt like building the 
                        airplane while we were already in the air. It was chaotic — and I loved it. I 
                        discovered something about myself during those years: I thrive in the space between 
                        the spark of an idea and the moment it becomes real. Where structure needs to be built, 
                        teams need to be rallied, and the path forward isn’t yet clear. That’s why I started 
                        Crafted Consulting. Today, I am confident to step in as a Fractional Director or VP, 
                        helping retail brands shape bold growth strategies and innovation pipelines, bring new 
                        concepts to market with operational excellence, and lead and energize teams through change.
                    </p>

                        At Starbucks, I was often tapped to unite teams around big, messy ideas and turn them into reality. 
                        My superpower is building structure while executing, so momentum never stops. I created new stage-gate
                        processes that accelerated implementation and took programs global — translating ideas into scalable 
                        strategies that deliver results.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s not about dropping in with a slide deck. It’s about rolling up my sleeves, partnering 
                        deeply, and building something that lasts. Fractional leadership gives companies the 
                        strategic horsepower they need — without the weight of a full-time hire — and gives me the 
                        chance to do what I love most: turning big ideas into reality, with joy. If your team is in 
                        that exciting, messy, growth-filled space — let’s talk about how we can craft what’s next, together.

                        Servant leadership is simple to describe but hard to live. At Crafted Consulting, this approach is at 
                        the core of how I work with clients:

                        <li>Listen deeply before offering solutions</li>
                        <li>Build systems that empower, not control</li>
                        <li>Leave teams stronger than I found them</li>
